    "text": "1.1 What types of CAFE communities can you think of?\nThe focus of a programming CAFE can vary depending on the needs and interests of the community. Here are some things to consider when defining the focus of your programming CAFE:\n1. Programming languages\nA programming CAFE can be focused on one specific programming language, several languages or language independent. For example, you might start a CAFE that focuses exclusively on Python, or you might create a more general CAFE that covers several programming languages, such as Python, R, and MATLAB. The choice of programming languages will depend on the interests and needs of the community.\n2. Skill level\nAnother factor to consider when defining the focus of your programming CAFE is the skill level of the participants. You might start a CAFE that is specifically designed for beginners, or you might create a more advanced CAFE that caters to experienced programmers. Alternatively, you might choose to create a CAFE that is open to researchers of all skill levels, with a focus on collaboration and knowledge-sharing.\n3. Research applications\nFinally, you might choose to define the focus of your programming CAFE based on specific research applications. For example, you might start a CAFE that focuses on using programming to analyze biological data, or you might create a CAFE that is dedicated to programming for social science research. The focus on research applications will depend on the interests and needs of the community."

    "text": "1.2 Why do you want a CAFE programming community in your university, faculty or organisation?\nProgramming has become an essential skill for many fields, including research. However, learning to code can be a challenging and sometimes isolating experience, especially for beginners. That’s where a programming community like CAFE can make a significant difference. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider starting a programming community in your university:\n1. Build a supportive community\nLearning to code can be a frustrating and challenging experience, especially when you’re stuck on a problem or error. Having a community of fellow programmers to turn to for support, advice, and encouragement can make all the difference. A programming community like CAFE can provide a supportive environment where researchers can connect with others who share their passion for programming and are eager to help them succeed.\n2. Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing\nProgramming is a collaborative activity, and having a community of programmers can help foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. By working together on projects, sharing tips and tricks, and discussing best practices, researchers can learn from each other and grow their skills faster than they would working alone.\n3. Provide access to resources and opportunities A programming community like CAFE can also provide access to resources and opportunities that might otherwise be difficult to find. For example, members of the community might share job or internship opportunities, recommend useful tools and libraries, or organize coding workshops and hackathons.\n4. Promote diversity and inclusion By actively promoting diversity and inclusion, a programming community like CAFE can help create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all researchers, regardless of their background or level of experience."

    "section": "1.3 Who is it for?",
    "text": "1.3 Who is it for?\nThe CAFE community is for researchers of all levels who are interested in programming, regardless of their field of study or level of experience. Here are some examples of personas who might benefit from participating in the community:\n1. The beginner programmer\nThe beginner programmer is just starting to learn how to code and may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of programming languages and tools. They might have a background in a non-technical field, such as the humanities or social sciences, and are interested in learning how to use programming to solve problems in their research. They might have followed a Introductory course, but get stuck as soon as they start working with their own data and therefore feel discouraged. The CAFE community can provide the beginner programmer with a supportive environment where they can connect with others who are also learning to code, ask questions, and get help when they need it.\n2. The advanced programmer\nThe advanced programmer is an experienced coder who has already developed a strong skill set in one or more programming languages. They might be looking for opportunities to share their knowledge with others, collaborate on projects, or learn about new tools, techniques or best practices related to Open Science and FAIR data and software. The CAFE community can provide the advanced programmer with a platform to share their expertise, connect with other skilled programmers, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.\n3. The interdisciplinary researcher\nThe interdisciplinary researcher comes from a field of study that traditionally has not emphasized programming, but recognizes the importance of using computational methods to answer research questions. They might have a basic understanding of programming concepts but lack the technical skills to implement them. The CAFE community can provide the interdisciplinary researcher with a supportive and collaborative environment where they can learn programming skills that are relevant to their research.\n4. The data specialist The data specialist is a researcher or support staff who specializes in working with datasets. They might be looking for opportunities to collaborate with other data experts, learn about new tools and techniques, or share their knowledge with researchers and others. The CAFE community can provide the data expert with a platform to connect with other researchers who share their interests, learn from each other, and collaborate on data-driven research projects.\nOverall, the focus of the CAFE can vary depending on the needs and interests of the community, including the choice of programming languages, skill level and research applications. By defining the focus of your programming CAFE, you can build a community and a programming CAFE that is tailored to the needs of your community and that provides valuable resources, opportunities, and support."

    "text": "3.1 Frequency\nFinding the right frequency for you as an organizer AND your community is crucial for the sustainability of your programming cafe. Your cafe will not be a success if you are eager to meet as often as possible, but your community consists of programmers with extremely busy schedules. Meeting too often may be exhausting for you as an organizer, and frustrating for your community as being pushed to constantly declining events may feel overwhelming. However, meeting only once in a blue moon is certainly not frequently enough to build strong bonds in your community.\nFinding the right balance is important. Try to find out what frequency may be seen as a standard for your audience and live within the rhythm of your institution. You can also reach out to partner institutions that already have experience and ask for advice. Nothing is written in stone: you can later change the frequency based on your experience.\nAs a suggestion: most of our coding cafes are organized on a monthly basis with a dynamic audience. That means that some people will join most of your events while others may only come irregularly for certain topics. However, some coding cafes do not follow a strict schedule but are organized ad-hoc once there are enough speakers, topics, or volunteers."

    "text": "3.2 Best dates & times\nFinding your rhythm is important, but not enough. Making exceptions to your frequency may be necessary. Some events may alter your planning such as for example:\n\nholidays (your attendance will probably be low if you plan an in-person coding event on Christmas Eve);\nvacation season (be mindful of potential school holiday breaks in your region if your community consists of programmers with families for example);\nexam or internship weeks at your university (if you are inviting students to your events make sure that they are around to join);\nmajor events at your institution that will be prioritized by your community (do not plan a coding cafe as an alternative to a major software related conference at your institution for example).\n\nAdditionally, planning around events that bring a lot of people together anyway may be beneficial. If you know that your audience will come together for a shorter event, you may want to try to get them after the event for your programming cafe.\nFinding the right week day and the best day time is equally important. A lot of institutions are offering telework options. Some of your colleagues may work part-time, or researchers may split their time between multiple institutions. That means that not everyone will be available to join an event on campus on certain days. If you know your audience well, you may avoid some pitfalls with setting the date. Mondays and Fridays may be preferred telework days for example, so plan accordingly on other days.\nDepending on your format, certain times during the day may be more suitable than others. If you offer food and drinks for example, you may benefit from setting your coding cafe during lunch hours or organize it in the late afternoons as an early dinner option."

    "text": "3.3 Food & drinks\nNo one likes to work on an empty stomach - same goes for programming. Offering food or drinks may help to increase the mood of the audience and may attract some additional people. There will probably be a lot of events and meetings to choose from on busy days, and offering snacks or drinks may help people to decide to spend their time at your coding cafe. Some advantages of offering food and drinks are:\n\nIncrease of attraction;\nIncrease of happiness;\nWorks as an icebreaker since people come together at a potential buffet.\n\nHowever, providing foods and drinks also comes with disadvantages such as\n\nIncrease of cost;\nIncrease of organizational effort.\n\nIf you order pizza for example for all participants, you need a higher budget and you have an additional effort of ordering and receiving pizza in time.\nThere is a vast amount of choices for selecting the right food and drinks for your audience. If you organize an event for a vegan audience, offering steaks for barbecue seems an odd choice. The same may be true for your audience. A traditional choice for programming events may be pizza and you probably can hardly go wrong with this all-time favorite. However, there may be better lunch options that can be distributed much easier, such as onigiri for example.\nDrinks can be organized in the same fashion depending on your audience’s preferences. Decide if you want to offer alcoholic options for example or if you need both, hot and cold drinks at the same time."

If you decide to organize an in-person event, you need to book a room that fits the needs of your event.\nThings you may need to consider are:\n\nRoom size;\nConvenient location of the room;\nAccessibility of the room;\nFindability of the room;\nNumber of power outlets;\nNumber of tables;\nAre food and drink consumption allowed?;\nPresenter options.\n\nAll in all, make sure that the idea of your programming cafe fits into the chosen room. 30 participants may not fit in a common meeting room. A room at a non-central building may be a barrier for your community since they need to travel there. Also make sure that your participants will be able to access the room, even if they don’t have access cards for example. Investing time into printing way points may pay off since it minimizes the risk that your participants get lost on the way to you. As an alternative, you can also provide a detailed description of how to get there in your invitation. Make sure that the room is fit for programming needs, e.g. power outlets and tables are required. As an alternative, you can organize extension cables or similar. Think also about your format: do you need a screen for presenting or a flipchart or room to freely move around. If you order pizza, make sure you are not thrown out of the room for smuggling greasy food into an auditorium."

That’s why we dedicate at least some part of the events on a presentation component on a programming related topic. These presentations can be given by an expert in the field or by someone from within the CAFE community who has knowledge to share.\n\n4.2.1 Benefits of presentations\nThe presentation component of CAFE serves several important purposes. First and foremost, it provides a platform for experts and community members to share their knowledge and insights on programming-related topics. This not only helps to deepen the knowledge and skills of individual community members, but it also promotes collaboration and mutual support among members of the CAFE community.\nSecondly, the presentation component helps to keep the CAFE community up-to-date on the latest trends, tools, and techniques in programming. By staying abreast of new developments in the field, community members can continue to grow and expand their skills, and can also explore new research opportunities.\nFinally, the presentation component is a great way to showcase the diverse range of interests and expertise within the CAFE community. By providing a platform for community members to share their knowledge and insights, we hope to foster a sense of pride and ownership within the community, and to encourage more community members to get involved and share their skills.\n\n\n4.2.2 Format of presentations\nThe format of the presentations will vary depending on the presenter and the topic being discussed. However, in general, presentations will be structured as a short talk followed by a Q&A session. This will give community members the opportunity to ask questions, clarify any points of confusion, and engage in a dialogue with the presenter.\n\n\n4.2.3 Topics covered\nThe topics covered in the presentations will also vary depending on the interests and needs of the community. Some examples of potential presentation topics might include:\n\nIntroduction to Python/R/MATLAB\nData visualization techniques\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence\nBest practices for coding and software development\nTips and tricks for debugging and troubleshooting\n\nBy covering a diverse range of topics, we hope to provide valuable resources and knowledge to community members of all skill levels and interests."

    "text": "9.2 Who can join\nThe R Café is open to anyone who works in R or is interested in learning. No prior experience with R is necessary - all are welcome! Many of our members have recently completed the Data Carpentry workshop and are looking for a space to continue practicing R skills with others. You can also join if you’ve got plenty of R experience and want to share some awesome tips and tricks (e.g., about an R package, type of analysis, or visualization) with others."

Because we know our audience, we offer a unique combination of ☕ and 🍕."
