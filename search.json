    "text": "1.1 What types of CAFE communities can you think of?\nThe focus of a programming CAFE can vary depending on the needs and interests of the community. Here are some things to consider when defining the focus of your programming CAFE:\n1. Programming languages\nA programming CAFE can be focused on one specific programming language, several languages or language independent. For example, you might start a CAFE that focuses exclusively on Python, or you might create a more general CAFE that covers several programming languages, such as Python, R, and MATLAB. The choice of programming languages will depend on the interests and needs of the community.\n2. Skill level\nAnother factor to consider when defining the focus of your programming CAFE is the skill level of the participants. You might start a CAFE that is specifically designed for beginners, or you might create a more advanced CAFE that caters to experienced programmers. Alternatively, you might choose to create a CAFE that is open to researchers of all skill levels, with a focus on collaboration and knowledge-sharing.\n3. Research applications\nFinally, you might choose to define the focus of your programming CAFE based on specific research applications. For example, you might start a CAFE that focuses on using programming to analyze biological data, or you might create a CAFE that is dedicated to programming for social science research. The focus on research applications will depend on the interests and needs of the community."

    "section": "1.2 Why do you want a CAFE programming community in your university, faculty or organisation?",
    "text": "1.2 Why do you want a CAFE programming community in your university, faculty or organisation?\nProgramming has become an essential skill for many fields, including research. However, learning to code can be a challenging and sometimes isolating experience, especially for beginners. That’s where a programming community like CAFE can make a significant difference. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider starting a programming community in your university:\n1. Build a supportive community\nLearning to code can be a frustrating and challenging experience, especially when you’re stuck on a problem or error. Having a community of fellow programmers to turn to for support, advice, and encouragement can make all the difference. A programming community like CAFE can provide a supportive environment where researchers can connect with others who share their passion for programming and are eager to help them succeed.\n2. Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing\nProgramming is a collaborative activity, and having a community of programmers can help foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. By working together on projects, sharing tips and tricks, and discussing best practices, researchers can learn from each other and grow their skills faster than they would working alone.\n3. Provide access to resources and opportunities A programming community like CAFE can also provide access to resources and opportunities that might otherwise be difficult to find. For example, members of the community might share job or internship opportunities, recommend useful tools and libraries, or organize coding workshops and hackathons.\n4. Promote diversity and inclusion By actively promoting diversity and inclusion, a programming community like CAFE can help create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all researchers, regardless of their background or level of experience."

    "section": "1.3 Who is it for?",
    "text": "1.3 Who is it for?\nThe CAFE community is for researchers of all levels who are interested in programming, regardless of their field of study or level of experience. Here are some examples of personas who might benefit from participating in the community:\n1. The beginner programmer\nThe beginner programmer is just starting to learn how to code and may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of programming languages and tools. They might have a background in a non-technical field, such as the humanities or social sciences, and are interested in learning how to use programming to solve problems in their research. They might have followed a Introductory course, but get stuck as soon as they start working with their own data and therefore feel discouraged. The CAFE community can provide the beginner programmer with a supportive environment where they can connect with others who are also learning to code, ask questions, and get help when they need it.\n2. The advanced programmer\nThe advanced programmer is an experienced coder who has already developed a strong skill set in one or more programming languages. They might be looking for opportunities to share their knowledge with others, collaborate on projects, or learn about new tools, techniques or best practices related to Open Science and FAIR data and software. The CAFE community can provide the advanced programmer with a platform to share their expertise, connect with other skilled programmers, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.\n3. The interdisciplinary researcher\nThe interdisciplinary researcher comes from a field of study that traditionally has not emphasized programming, but recognizes the importance of using computational methods to answer research questions. They might have a basic understanding of programming concepts but lack the technical skills to implement them. The CAFE community can provide the interdisciplinary researcher with a supportive and collaborative environment where they can learn programming skills that are relevant to their research.\n4. The data specialist The data specialist is a researcher or support staff who specializes in working with datasets. They might be looking for opportunities to collaborate with other data experts, learn about new tools and techniques, or share their knowledge with researchers and others. The CAFE community can provide the data expert with a platform to connect with other researchers who share their interests, learn from each other, and collaborate on data-driven research projects.\nOverall, the focus of the CAFE can vary depending on the needs and interests of the community, including the choice of programming languages, skill level and research applications. By defining the focus of your programming CAFE, you can build a community and a programming CAFE that is tailored to the needs of your community and that provides valuable resources, opportunities, and support."

    "text": "4.2 Presentation component\nAt CAFE, we believe that knowledge-sharing is key to fostering a supportive and collaborative community. That’s why we dedicate at least some part of the events on a presentation component on a programming related topic. These presentations can be given by an expert in the field or by someone from within the CAFE community who has knowledge to share.\n\n4.2.1 Benefits of presentations\nThe presentation component of CAFE serves several important purposes. First and foremost, it provides a platform for experts and community members to share their knowledge and insights on programming-related topics. This not only helps to deepen the knowledge and skills of individual community members, but it also promotes collaboration and mutual support among members of the CAFE community.\nSecondly, the presentation component helps to keep the CAFE community up-to-date on the latest trends, tools, and techniques in programming. By staying abreast of new developments in the field, community members can continue to grow and expand their skills, and can also explore new research opportunities.\nFinally, the presentation component is a great way to showcase the diverse range of interests and expertise within the CAFE community. By providing a platform for community members to share their knowledge and insights, we hope to foster a sense of pride and ownership within the community, and to encourage more community members to get involved and share their skills.\n\n\n4.2.2 Format of presentations\nThe format of the presentations will vary depending on the presenter and the topic being discussed. However, in general, presentations will be structured as a short talk followed by a Q&A session. This will give community members the opportunity to ask questions, clarify any points of confusion, and engage in a dialogue with the presenter.\n\n\n4.2.3 Topics covered\nThe topics covered in the presentations will also vary depending on the interests and needs of the community. Some examples of potential presentation topics might include:\n\nIntroduction to Python/R/MATLAB\nData visualization techniques\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence\nBest practices for coding and software development\nTips and tricks for debugging and troubleshooting\n\nBy covering a diverse range of topics, we hope to provide valuable resources and knowledge to community members of all skill levels and interests."
